# Feature Notes

- There's currently no way to support Pandemic or Visual Alert effects on the Tracked Buffs bar due to lack of Masque support
- Since it appears that Masque Skinner: Blizz Buffs is no longer maintained, I hope to add support for Buffs, Debuffs, and External Defensives in an uncoming release
