# Version 12.0.0.0

- Improved overall support for Cooldown Manager in Retail
  - Added support for coloring debuff types on Tracked Buffs in Retail 12.0.0 (fixes #6)
  - Split the Cooldown Manager group into Tracked Buffs, Essential Cooldowns, and Utility Cooldowns (fixes #7)
- Updated TOC for Retail 12.0.1 (Beta)

## Notes

- Since it appears that Masque Skinner: Blizz Buffs is no longer maintained, I hope to add support for Buffs, Debuffs, and External Defensives in an uncoming release
- There's currently no way to support Pandemic or Alert Visual effects on the Tracked Buffs bar due to lack of Masque support
