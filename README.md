# About

This addon enables [Masque](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/masque "Masque") to skin the built-in WoW action bars.  It can currently skin Main Action Bar, Multi Bars (Action Bars 2 - 8), Possess Bar, Stance Bar, Pet Bar, and Spell Flyout.  It requires Masque to function and is configurable only with Masque's settings UI.  Each bar is its own group so you can configure the skin for each independently.

If you use a bar mod like Bartender or ElvUI, your mod _already_ supports Masque and you won't get anything from this addon.

You can install this addon from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/masque-blizz-bars-revived "CurseForge").

I have not tested this with Classic or Wrath Classic, but if there's enough interest I may accept patches.

Note: This code is derived from [Masque Blizz Bars](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/masque-blizz-bars "Masque Blizz Bars") which is presently marked as abandoned on CurseForge.  The code was listed as GPL-3 in its original location, so that is assumed to be correct and it will continue to be distributed under that license unless otherwise requested by the original author.
