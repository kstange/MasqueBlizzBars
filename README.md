# About Masque Blizzard Bars

This addon enables [Masque](https://github.com/SFX-WoW/Masque) ([CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/masque), [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/masque), [WoWInterface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info12097-Masque.html)) to skin the built-in WoW action bars.  An up-to-date version of Masque is required for it to work.

If you like the base WoW interface and don't want to use a separate action bar mod, you're in the right place.

You can install this addon from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/masque-blizz-bars-revived "CurseForge"), [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/masqueblizzbars), or [WoWInterface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info26502-MasqueBlizzardBars.html).

## Features

Masque Blizzard Bars can currently skin the following bars, according to your game version:

- Main Action Bar
- Multi Bars (Action Bars 2 - 8)
- Possess Bar
- Stance Bar
- Pet Bar
- Vehicle Bar
- Pet Battle Bar
- Extra Ability Buttons (Extra Action Button, Zone Ability Buttons)
- Spell Flyout
- Cooldown Manager (with each bar type configured indepdendently)
  - Essential Cooldowns
  - Utility Cooldowns
  - Tracked Buffs

Support for Buffs, Debuffs and External Defensives is planned in a future update.

Each bar type is its own group so you can configure them independently from Masque's Skin Settings.

## Classic Support

Bars that exist in Classic versions available in the US are fully supported. Bars not available in Classic will not appear in Masque's Skin Settings.

I don't play Classic so testing is somewhat limited. I also haven't been able to validate compatibility with Titan Reforged servers in China.

I'll do my best to address bug reports promptly.

## Compatibility

This addon is intended to skin the base WoW interface. Addons that heavily modify parts of the base interface may conflict. If you experience a conflict, use Masque's Skin Settings to disable the affected group and reload your UI. This should allow the other addon to control the interface without interference.

If you'd like to see Masque support in a conflicting addon, try sending a feature request to that addon's author directly.
