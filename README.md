# About Masque Blizzard Bars

You can install this addon from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/masque-blizz-bars-revived "CurseForge"), [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/masqueblizzbars), or [WoWInterface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info26502-MasqueBlizzardBars.html).

This addon enables [Masque](https://github.com/SFX-WoW/Masque) ([CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/masque), [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/masque), [WoWInterface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info12097-Masque.html)) to skin the built-in WoW action bars.  It requires Masque to function and is configurable only with Masque's settings UI.  It can currently skin the following bars:

* Main Action Bar
* Multi Bars (Action Bars 2 - 8)
* Possess Bar
* Stance Bar
* Pet Bar
* Vehicle Bar
* Pet Battle Bar
* Extra Ability Buttons (Extra Action Button, Zone Ability Button)
* Spell Flyout

Each bar is its own group so you can configure the skin for each independently.

If you like the Dragonflight action bar improvements and don't want to use a bar mod, this is for you.  If you do use a bar mod like Bartender or ElvUI, your interface _already_ supports Masque and you won't get anything from this addon.  If your mod is set up to leave some of the system bars intact, you should be able to safely use this alongside it.

## Classic Support

I have not tested this with Classic Era or Wrath Classic, but I may add support when I have time.  If you want to help, you can submit patches.

## Localization

If you'd like to help localize this addon, please submit translations [here](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/masque-blizz-bars-revived/localization).

## Other Mods

If you're looking to skin the built-in Inventory UI elements as well, check out [Masque Blizzard Inventory](/kstange/MasqueBlizzInv) ([CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/masque-blizz-inventory "CurseForge"), [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/masqueblizzinv), [WoWInterface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info26503-MasqueBlizzardInventory.html))!
